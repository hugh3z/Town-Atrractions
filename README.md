I aimed to create a tourist website on St. Andrews, Scotland. 

Colour choices:
I will aim for my website to follow a beach theme as St. Andrews is a seaside town.
To achieve this I stuck to different shades of blue and yellow to create an illusion of sea and sand. To enhance this I have taken advantage of background images on my buttons and borders to add interesting textures to the website. 

My font sizes and text followed after colour choices where along with fitting the website I wanted to make these easy to read so that the website was accessible to more communities. 
My website features lots of bold and large fonts to achieve this. 

Along with the text throughout the creation of the whole website, I thought about how to make my layout and website navigation as user-friendly as possible. To do this, I made a clear nav bar along the top of the page
where it is stereotypical to find such. I also included large widgets and ensured all my pages were clearly labeled. The layout became simple after this as I had to make sure it remained clear on different device types.

I faced challenges while coding my websites. One main challenge I faced was ensuring the website was responsive on different devices, especially mobile. I used Google developer tools to check my website myself and edit the 
HTML accordingly. To further test this I had a test case navigate through the website on their phone. When doing so, I noticed that the embedded map affected the rest of the content on the home page.
I was unable to overcome this challenge when doing my HTML despite efforts to debug. 
Another issue I faced was the file paths. In the initial stages of my website, I was coming into multiple errors with my images not displaying and the links to other pages failing. This issue was resolved when
I realized it was down to the organization of the files in the file tree. This issue is now resolved and runs well. 

Overall, I am happy with my website as I believe it captures the small beach town of St. Andrews well through the color choices. I also believe my website is very user-friendly and accessible. In future
I would be more on top of checking the responsiveness of my webpage throughout rather than at the end when all the HTML is implemented. I would also be more aware of where i am uploading images and creating new
HTML docs within the file tree to ensure all file paths are correct within the HTML.
